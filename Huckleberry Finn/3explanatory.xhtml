  <h1>Explanatory</h1>

<blockquote>	
	<p>In this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary "Pike County" dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.</p>

  <p>I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding.</p>

  <p>THE AUTHOR.</p>
